### Next Steps
- Unable to design a score box. Will complete a score box design.
- Unable to design large pop up when a player either wins or calls war. Will write CSS code and Javascript function to trigger alert.
- Unable to design the motion for the center deck of cards to distribute to each player and write a function. Will create in CSS to add visual of card distribution and Javascript to render that function.
